# Introduction

This document will walk you through the implementation of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) feature.

The feature involves setting up a CNN for image classification using <SwmToken path="/cnn.py" pos="1:2:2" line-data="import tensorflow as tf">`tensorflow`</SwmToken> and Keras.

We will cover:

1. Data preprocessing and augmentation.
2. Model architecture setup.
3. Model compilation and training.

# Data preprocessing and augmentation

We start by setting up the data preprocessing and augmentation pipeline. This is crucial for improving the generalization of the model by artificially expanding the dataset.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator
import numpy as np


# Assuming you have a dataset of images organized into folders
train_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1./255,
                                   shear_range=0.2,
                                   zoom_range=0.2,
                                   horizontal_flip=True)
```

The <SwmToken path="/cnn.py" pos="4:12:12" line-data="from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator">`ImageDataGenerator`</SwmToken> is configured to rescale pixel values, apply shear transformations, zoom, and horizontal flips. This helps in creating a more robust model by introducing variations in the training data.
